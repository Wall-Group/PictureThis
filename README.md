## Overview
### Description
A net 64x64 RGB LED matrix is mounted on the wall at roughly child-height (TBD). LEDs can be lit or dimmed using a cursor controlled by a joystick. The cursor can cycle between three sizes depending on user preference. Eight different colors can be chosen for each led (including off). A user can turn off all LEDs on the board using a single button.

## Instructions

1. Use the joystick to move the pen.
2. Set the color with one of the 8 available color buttons.
3. Change the pen size with the pen button.
4. Clear the screen with the reset button.

## UserStories
### Required User Stories

#### Designer can select one or more LEDs using the joystick
* Reason: The joystick allows the designer to create designs. If they couldn't use the joystick to select an LED, they would have no way of interacting with the display.

#### Designer can set the size of the cursor using a button
* Reason: Given the number of LEDs on the display, it might be tedious to light one LED at a time. Allowing the designer to select more than one LED simultaneously fosters a positive experience.

#### Designer can select/change LED color (including off)
* Reason: This is a multi-color display. Designers will want to use more than one color or turn off an LED depending on the desired design

#### Designer can see which LED is selected
* Reason: The designer needs to know which LED they are currently drawing on or setting the color for

#### Designed can erase the entire display at once
* Reason: Turning off each LED individually is tedious. An instant clean start is desirable in some scenarios

<br>

### Optional User Stories

#### Designer can play a game on the matrix
* Reason: This accepts a wider audience- instead of pure design, the display becomes interactive.
